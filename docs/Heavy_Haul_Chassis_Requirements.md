# ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION

## Heavy-Haul Chassis Integration Requirements

**Document Number:** ENG-CHASSIS-HH-2026-001  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Classification:** Internal Use

## 1. OVERVIEW

This specification defines chassis integration requirements for heavy-haul configurations exceeding 100,000 lbs GCWR. Heavy-haul operations place exceptional demands on frame, suspension, and braking systems that require careful component selection and validation.

## 2. APPLICATION SCOPE

Applies to:
- **MDL-HEAVYHAUL** - All configurations
- **MDL-PREMIUM** - When configured for heavy-haul duty cycle

## 3. FRAME REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Frame Rail Specifications

| Configuration | Minimum RBM | Required Frame Type |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Up to 80,000 GCWR | 2.4M in-lb | Heavy-Duty Steel |
| 80,001-100,000 GCWR | 3.0M in-lb | Extra Heavy-Duty |
| Over 100,000 GCWR | 3.8M in-lb | Vocational Heavy-Haul |

### 3.2 Wheelbase Considerations

For heavy-haul applications:
- **Minimum wheelbase:** 245 inches for weight distribution
- **Recommended:** 280 inches for maximum stability
- Extended wheelbases improve fifth wheel positioning for oversized loads

## 4. SUSPENSION REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 Front Axle

| GCWR Range | Minimum Rating | Recommended |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Up to 80,000 | 18,000 lbs | Air-ride front |
| Over 80,000 | 20,000 lbs | Independent air suspension |
| Over 100,000 | 22,000 lbs | Independent air suspension |

### 4.2 Rear Suspension

Heavy-haul configurations require:
- **Type:** Air-ride mandatory for loads over 80,000 GCWR
- **Rating:** Elite air-ride package for over 100,000 GCWR
- **Feature:** Cab-coupled system recommended for driver comfort

## 5. BRAKE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 Minimum Requirements

All heavy-haul configurations must include:
- **Front brakes:** Air disc brakes required (drum brakes not acceptable)
- **Rear brakes:** Air disc brakes required for consistent stopping power
- **Stability:** Full electronic stability control with rollover prevention

### 5.2 Engine Brake Integration

For sustained grade operation:
- Engine brake must provide minimum 500 HP braking force
- Three-stage or full retarder recommended
- Integrated with transmission for seamless operation

## 6. FIFTH WHEEL REQUIREMENTS

| Application | Minimum Type | Weight Rating |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Standard Heavy-Haul | Compensating | 150,000 lbs |
| Maximum Capacity | Heavy-Haul Dedicated | 200,000 lbs |

## 7. CONFIGURATION VALIDATION

Heavy-haul configurations receive enhanced validation:

1. Frame stress analysis for selected wheelbase
2. Brake balance verification
3. Suspension compatibility check
4. Fifth wheel rating vs. intended GCWR

**Non-compliant configurations will be flagged with required corrections.**
