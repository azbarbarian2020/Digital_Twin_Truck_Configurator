## 1. OVERVIEW

This specification defines the engineering requirements and supporting component integration parameters for the 605 HP high-output diesel engine package. This engine is designed for heavy-haul and premium long-haul applications requiring maximum power output and sustained high-load operation capability.

The 605 HP engine represents the flagship powertrain option in the commercial truck lineup, featuring advanced turbocharging, enhanced cooling systems, and upgraded drivetrain components to handle increased torque loads.

## 2. APPLICATION SCOPE

This specification applies to the following truck models and configurations:

- **Heavy-Haul Series (MDL-HEAVYHAUL)** - Primary application
- **Premium Long-Haul Series (MDL-PREMIUM)** - Optional upgrade
- **Long-Haul Series (MDL-LONGHAUL)** - Special order only

**Note:** Not compatible with Regional or Fleet series due to chassis weight rating limitations.

## 3. ENGINE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS

| Parameter | Specification | Tolerance |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Rated Power Output | 605 HP @ 1,800 RPM | ±2% |
| Peak Torque | 2,050 lb-ft @ 1,200 RPM | ±3% |
| Displacement | 15.0 Liters | Nominal |
| Compression Ratio | 17.5:1 | Fixed |
| Governed Speed | 2,100 RPM | ±50 RPM |
| Idle Speed | 600 RPM | ±25 RPM |
| Fuel Consumption (Peak) | 0.315 lb/hp-hr | Target |

## 4. SUPPORTING COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS

The following supporting systems must meet minimum specifications for 605 HP engine installations. These requirements ensure proper thermal management, drivetrain durability, and safe operation. **Configuration validation will verify compliance with these requirements.**

### 4.1 Turbocharger Requirements

The increased airflow demands of the 605 HP engine require enhanced forced induction:
- **Minimum boost pressure:** 45 PSI
- **HP rating:** Must support at least 600 horsepower
- **Recommended:** Twin variable geometry turbo (twin-VGT) configuration for optimal transient response

### 4.2 Radiator and Cooling System Requirements

Heat rejection requirements increase significantly at 605 HP sustained operation:
- **Minimum cooling capacity:** 350,000 BTU per hour
- **Radiator class:** Heavy-duty required
- **Core rows:** Minimum of 5 core rows for adequate heat transfer surface area

**Note:** Standard-duty cooling systems are not acceptable for this application.

### 4.3 Transmission Requirements

The drivetrain must accommodate the increased torque output:
- **Torque rating:** Minimum 1,850 lb-ft to handle peak engine torque with safety margin
- **Type:** Automated manual transmission (AMT) premium class or heavy-duty manual
- **Gear count:** 12-speed or higher recommended for fuel efficiency optimization

### 4.4 Engine Brake Requirements

Enhanced engine braking capability is mandatory for safe operation at maximum power levels:
- **Minimum braking horsepower:** 500 HP for adequate retardation on grades
- **Type:** Full engine retarder required - compression release brakes alone are not sufficient
- **Modulation:** Minimum 3 stages for proportional braking control

## 5. CONFIGURATION VALIDATION

All 605 HP engine installations must pass automated configuration validation prior to production release. The validation system will:

1. Analyze selected components against Section 4 requirements
2. Flag any incompatibilities or specification gaps
3. Provide recommended fixes for non-compliant configurations

**Configurations that do not meet these requirements may result in warranty limitations or operational restrictions.**
